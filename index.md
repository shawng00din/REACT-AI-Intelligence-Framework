# Rethinking AI Intelligence: The REACT Framework

**Shawn Goodin â€“ 03-25-2025**

## Abstract

This paper introduces the REACT AI Intelligence framework, a novel approach to categorizing and assessing artificial intelligence systems based on their cognitive intelligence capabilities. While existing AI frameworks primarily focus on autonomy and human-AI collaboration, REACT addresses a critical gap by examining the quality and sophistication of AI reasoning itself. By providing a cognitive perspective on AI maturity, REACT offers researchers, developers, and organizations a valuable tool for understanding, assessing, and advancing AI intelligence in a thoughtful, strategic, and responsible manner.

## 1. Introduction: The Need for a Cognitive Perspective on AI

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has created an urgent need for frameworks that can meaningfully categorize and assess AI capabilities. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, organizations and researchers require clear ways to understand, evaluate, and communicate about AI intelligence.

Current AI maturity models predominantly focus on three aspects:

- **The degree of autonomy AI systems possess**

- **The nature of human-AI collaboration**

- **Organizational adoption and implementation processes**

These frameworks provide valuable insights into how AI operates within organizational contexts and how humans interact with AI systems. However, they leave a critical gap in our understanding: they do not address the cognitive intelligence capabilities of AI systems themselves.

Consider the following questions that existing frameworks struggle to answer:

- How do we assess the quality and sophistication of AI reasoning?

- What distinguishes a cognitively advanced AI system from a basic one?

- How does AI intelligence evolve through distinct developmental stages?

- What are the internal cognitive mechanisms that enable increasingly sophisticated AI capabilities?

The REACT framework was developed specifically to address these questions by providing a cognitive perspective on AI intelligence maturity.

## 2. The Landscape of Existing AI Frameworks

### 2.1 Autonomy-Focused Frameworks

Most prominent AI frameworks focus primarily on autonomy and human-AI collaboration rather than cognitive intelligence:

**Microsoft's AI Maturity Model**

- Assisted Intelligence: AI gives insights, humans decide

- Augmented Intelligence: AI boosts human decision-making

- Autonomous Intelligence: AI makes decisions on its own

**PwC's AI Augmentation Spectrum**

- Advisor: AI suggests

- Assistant: AI helps

- Co-Creator: AI works with you

- Executor: AI handles tasks

- Decision-Maker: AI decides

- Self-Learner: AI improves itself

**Deloitte's Augmented Intelligence Framework**

- Automate: AI takes over repetitive tasks

- Augment: AI enhances human decisions

- Amplify: AI scales human capabilities

**Gartner's Autonomous Systems Framework**

- Manual: Humans only

- Assisted: AI supports

- Semi-Autonomous: AI does most, humans step in if needed

- Fully Autonomous: AI runs the show

**MIT's Human-in-the-Loop Model**

- AI Automation: AI handles everything

- Human-in-the-Loop: Humans review or decide

- Human Override: Humans can step in when needed

**HBR's Human-AI Teaming Model**

- Tool: AI provides insights

- Collaborator: AI shares tasks

- Manager: AI handles admin tasks

### 2.2 Common Patterns and Limitations

These frameworks share several common patterns:

- **Focus on Autonomy:** They primarily measure the degree of autonomy or independence from human oversight.

- **Human-AI Relationship:** They define progression in terms of changing relationships between humans and AI systems.

- **Task Execution:** Progress is measured by which entity (human or AI) performs tasks or makes decisions.

- **External Behavior:** They focus on observable behaviors rather than internal cognitive processes.

- **Organizational Perspective:** Most frameworks are designed from an organizational adoption perspective rather than a technical capability perspective.

While these frameworks effectively measure autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and organizational adoption, they do not address:

- **Cognitive Sophistication:** The quality and complexity of AI reasoning

- **Intelligence Types:** Different forms of intelligence exhibited by AI systems

- **Cognitive Development:** How AI intelligence evolves through distinct stages

- **Internal Processes:** The mechanisms by which AI systems process information

- **Intelligence Quality:** Measures of how well AI systems think, not just what tasks they perform

This gap highlights the need for a framework that focuses specifically on AI intelligence from a cognitive perspective, which is precisely what the REACT framework addresses.

## 3. Introducing the REACT Framework

The REACT framework represents a novel approach to categorizing and assessing AI systems based on their functional intelligence capabilities rather than their autonomy or human-AI collaboration patterns. It examines how AI systems themselves manifest different levels of cognitive capability, providing a framework for understanding what AI systems can actually do at different stages of intelligence maturity.

**REACT stands for:**

- **R**ecognition (or Replicate in the original version)

- **E**valuation (or Enhance in the original version)

- **A**nalysis (or Assemble in the original version)

- **C**orrelation (or Create in the original version)

- **T**hinking (or Transfer in the original version)

These five progressive levels represent a developmental path of AI cognitive capabilities, from basic pattern recognition to sophisticated abstract reasoning and cross-domain innovation.

### Theoretical Foundations

The REACT framework is grounded in established cognitive science theories, particularly Marr's three levels of analysis. As Yamins and DiCarlo (2016) note in their paper *Using goal-driven deep learning models to understand sensory cortex*, Marr's framework provides a powerful approach for understanding intelligent systems by distinguishing between:

- **Computational Level (what the system does and why):** Maps to the purpose of each REACT level

- **Algorithmic Level (how the system does it):** Maps to the implementation approaches at each level

- **Implementation Level (physical realization):** Maps to the technical requirements for each level

This theoretical foundation aligns with recent research in cognitive science approaches to understanding AI systems. In *Using the Tools of Cognitive Science to Understand Large Language Models at Different Levels of Analysis* (Mahowald et al., 2023), the authors argue that cognitive science frameworks provide valuable perspectives for understanding AI capabilities and limitations.

By mapping each REACT level to Marr's framework, the model gains theoretical coherence and academic validity. This alignment helps explain why certain capabilities naturally precede others and provides a principled basis for the progressive structure of the framework.

### 3.2 A Multidimensional Approach to Intelligence

Rather than defining intelligence by a single capability, REACT recognizes that intelligence manifests across multiple dimensions:

- **Knowledge Representation:** How information is structured and stored

- **Reasoning Mechanisms:** How the system processes information

- **Learning Capacity:** How the system improves over time

- **Autonomy:** Degree of independent operation

- **Generalization:** Ability to apply learning to new contexts

This multidimensional approach aligns with contemporary research on AI capabilities. As noted by Chollet (2019) in *On the Measure of Intelligence*, meaningful assessment of intelligence requires evaluating systems across multiple dimensions rather than on narrow task performance.

This approach enables a more nuanced assessment of AI systems and helps identify specific areas for improvement.

## 4. The Five Levels of the REACT Framework

### 4.1 Level 1: Recognition / Replicate

**Cognitive Characteristics:**

- Pattern Recognition: Identifying recurring structures in data
